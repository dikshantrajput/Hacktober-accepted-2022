        <h1>Gandalf</h1>
        <p>
          <strong>Gandalf</strong>&nbsp; is a protagonist in J. R. R. Tolkien's
          novels The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. He is a wizard, one of
          the Istari order, and the leader of the Fellowship of the Ring.
          Tolkien took the name "Gandalf" from the Old Norse "Catalogue of
          Dwarves" (Dvergatal) in the Völuspá.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a wizard and the bearer of one of the Three Rings, Gandalf has
          great power, but works mostly by encouraging and persuading. He sets
          out as Gandalf the Grey, possessing great knowledge and travelling
          continually. Gandalf is focused on the mission to counter the Dark
          Lord Sauron by destroying the One Ring. He is associated with fire;
          his ring of power is Narya, the Ring of Fire. As such, he delights in
          fireworks to entertain the hobbits of the Shire, while in great need
          he uses fire as a weapon. As one of the Maiar, he is an immortal
          spirit from Valinor, but his physical body can be killed.

          In The Hobbit, Gandalf assists the dwarves and the hobbit Bilbo with
          their quest to retake the Lonely Mountain from Smaug the dragon, but
          leaves them to urge the White Council to expel Sauron from his
          fortress of Dol Guldur. In the quest, Bilbo finds a magical ring. The
          expulsion succeeds, but in The Lord of the Rings, Gandalf reveals that
          Sauron's retreat was only a feint, as he soon reappeared in Mordor.
          Gandalf further explains that, after years of investigation, he is
          sure that Bilbo's ring is the One Ring that Sauron needs to dominate
          the whole of Middle-earth. The Council of Elrond creates the
          Fellowship of the Ring, with Gandalf as its leader, to defeat Sauron
          by destroying the Ring. He takes them south and through the Misty
          Mountains, but is killed fighting a Balrog, an evil spirit-being, in
          the underground realm of Moria. After he dies, he is sent back from
          Valinor to Middle-earth to complete his mission as Gandalf the White.
          He reappears in dazzling light to three of the Fellowship and helps to
          counter the enemy in Rohan, then in Gondor, and finally at the Black
          Gate of Mordor, in each case largely by offering guidance. When
          victory is complete, he crowns Aragorn as King before leaving
          Middle-earth for ever to return to Valinor.
        </p>

        <p>
          Tolkien once described Gandalf as an angel incarnate; later, both he
          and other scholars have likened Gandalf to the Norse god Odin in his
          "Wanderer" guise. Others have described Gandalf as a guide-figure who
          assists the protagonist, comparable to the Cumaean Sibyl who assisted
          Aeneas in Virgil's The Aeneid, or to Virgil himself in Dante's
          Inferno. Scholars have likened his return in white to the
          transfiguration of Christ; he is further described as a prophet,
          representing one element of Christ's threefold office of prophet,
          priest, and king, where the other two roles are taken by Frodo and
          Aragorn.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Gandalf character has been featured in radio, television, stage,
          video game, music, and film adaptations, including Ralph Bakshi's 1978
          animated film. His best-known portrayal is by Ian McKellen in Peter
          Jackson's 2001–2003 The Lord of the Rings film series, where the actor
          based his acclaimed performance on Tolkien himself. McKellen reprised
          the role in Jackson's 2012–2014 film series The Hobbit.

            means staff-elf.

            This is reflected in his name Tharkûn, which is "said to mean
            'Staff-man'" in Khuzdul, one of Tolkien's invented languages.

          <h2>In-universe names</h2>
          <p>
            Gandalf is given several names and nicknames in Tolkien's writings.
            Faramir calls him the Grey Pilgrim, and reports Gandalf as saying,
            "Many are my names in many countries. Mithrandir among the Elves,
            Tharkûn to the Dwarves, Olórin I was in my youth in the West that is
            forgotten, in the South Incánus, in the North Gandalf; to the East I
            go not."
          </p>
          <p>
            In an early manuscript version of The Hobbit, he is called
            Bladorthin. The name Gandalf is used by the dwarf who later became
            Thorin Oakenshield.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each Wizard is distinguished by the colour of his cloak. For most of
            his manifestation as a wizard, Gandalf's cloak is grey, hence the
            names Gandalf the Grey and Greyhame, from Old English hame, "cover,
            skin". Mithrandir is a name in Sindarin meaning "the Grey Pilgrim"
            or "the Grey Wanderer". Midway through The Lord of the Rings,
            Gandalf becomes the head of the order of Wizards, and is renamed
            Gandalf the White. This change in status (and clothing) introduces
            another name for the wizard: the White Rider. However, characters
            who speak Elvish still refer to him as Mithrandir. At times in The
            Lord of the Rings, other characters address Gandalf by insulting
            nicknames: Stormcrow, Láthspell ("Ill-news" in Old English), and
            "Grey Fool".

      <div id="characteristics">
        <h1>Characteristics</h1>
        <p>
          Tolkien describes Gandalf as the last of the wizards to appear in
          Middle-earth, one who "seemed the least, less tall than the others,
          and in looks more aged, grey-haired and grey-clad, and leaning on a
          staff". Yet the Elf Círdan who met him on arrival nevertheless
          considered him "the greatest spirit and the wisest" and gave him the
          Elven Ring of Power called Narya, the Ring of Fire, containing a "red"
          stone for his aid and comfort. Tolkien explicitly links Gandalf to the
          element fire later in the same essay:
        </p>
        <p id="box-1">
          Warm and eager was his spirit (and it was enhanced by the ring Narya),
          for he was the Enemy of Sauron, opposing the fire that devours and
          wastes with the fire that kindles, and succours in wanhope and
          distress; but his joy, and his swift wrath, were veiled in garments
          grey as ash, so that only those that knew him well glimpsed the flame
          that was within. Merry he could be, and kindly to the young and
          simple, yet quick at times to sharp speech and the rebuking of folly;
          but he was not proud, and sought neither power nor praise ... Mostly
          he journeyed tirelessly on foot, leaning on a staff, and so he was
          called among Men of the North Gandalf 'the Elf of the Wand'. For they
          deemed him (though in error) to be of Elven-kind, since he would at
          times work wonders among them, loving especially the beauty of fire;
          and yet such marvels he wrought mostly for mirth and delight, and
          desired not that any should hold him in awe or take his counsels out
          of fear. ... Yet it is said that in the ending of the task for which
          he came he suffered greatly, and was slain, and being sent back from
          death for a brief while was clothed then in white, and became a
          radiant flame (yet veiled still save in great need).

        <div id="valinor">
          <h2>Valinor</h2>
          <p>
            In Valinor, Gandalf was called Olórin. He was one of the Maiar of
            Valinor, specifically, one of the people of the Vala Manwë; he was
            said to be the wisest of the Maiar. He was closely associated with
            two other Valar: Irmo, in whose gardens he lived, and Nienna, the
            patron of mercy, who gave him tutelage. When the Valar decided to
            send the order of the Wizards (Istari) across the Great Sea to
            Middle-earth to counsel and assist all those who opposed Sauron,
            Olórin was proposed by Manwë. Olórin initially begged to be excused,
            declaring he was too weak and that he feared Sauron, but Manwë
            replied that that was all the more reason for him to go.
          </p>
          <p>
            As one of the Maiar, Gandalf was not a mortal Man but an angelic
            being who had taken human form. As one of those spirits, Olórin was
            in service to the Creator (Eru Ilúvatar) and the Creator's 'Secret
            Fire'. Along with the other Maiar who entered into Middle-earth as
            the five Wizards, he took on the specific form of an old man as a
            sign of his humility. The role of the wizards was to advise and
            counsel but never to attempt to match Sauron's strength with their
            own. It might be, too, that the kings and lords of Middle-earth
            would be more receptive to the advice of a humble old man than a
            more glorious form giving them direct commands.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div id="middle-earth">
          <h2>Middle-Earth</h2>
          <p>
            The wizards arrived in Middle-earth separately, early in the Third
            Age; Gandalf was the last, landing in the Havens of Mithlond. He
            seemed the oldest and least in stature, but Círdan the Shipwright
            felt that he was the greatest on their first meeting in the Havens,
            and gave him Narya, the Ring of Fire. Saruman, the chief Wizard,
            learned of the gift and resented it. Gandalf hid the ring well, and
            it was not widely known until he left with the other ring-bearers at
            the end of the Third Age that he, and not Círdan, was the holder of
            the third of the Elven-rings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gandalf's relationship with Saruman, the head of their Order, was
            strained. The Wizards were commanded to aid Men, Elves, and Dwarves,
            but only through counsel; they were forbidden to use force to
            dominate them, though Saruman increasingly disregarded this.
          </p>

          <div id="the-white-council">
            <h3>The White Council</h3>
            <p>
              Gandalf suspected early on that an evil presence, the Necromancer
              of Dol Guldur, was not a Nazgûl but Sauron himself. He went to Dol
              Guldur to discover the truth, but the Necromancer withdrew before
              him, only to return with greater force,and the White Council was
              formed in response. Galadriel had hoped Gandalf would lead the
              council, but he refused, declining to be bound by any but the
              Valar who had sent him. Saruman was chosen instead, as the most
              knowledgeable about Sauron's work in the Second Age.
            </p>
            <p>
              Gandalf returned to Dol Guldur "at great peril" and learned that
              the Necromancer was indeed Sauron. The following year a White
              Council was held, and Gandalf urged that Sauron be driven out.
              Saruman, however, reassured the Council that Sauron's evident
              effort to find the One Ring would fail, as the Ring would long
              since have been carried by the river Anduin to the Sea; and the
              matter was allowed to rest. But Saruman began actively seeking the
              Ring near the Gladden Fields where Isildur had been killed.

              "The Quest of Erebor" in Unfinished Tales elaborates upon the
              story behind The Hobbit. It tells of a chance meeting between
              Gandalf and Thorin Oakenshield, a Dwarf-king in exile, in the
              Prancing Pony inn at Bree. Gandalf had for some time foreseen the
              coming war with Sauron, and knew that the North was especially
              vulnerable. If Rivendell were to be attacked, the dragon Smaug
              could cause great devastation. He persuaded Thorin that he could
              help him regain his lost territory of Erebor from Smaug, and so
              the quest was born.

          <p>
            Gandalf meets with Bilbo in the opening of The Hobbit. He arranges
            for a tea party, to which he invites the thirteen dwarves, and thus
            arranges the travelling group central to the narrative. Gandalf
            contributes the map and key to Erebor to assist the quest. On this
            quest Gandalf acquires the sword, Glamdring, from the trolls'
            treasure hoard. Elrond informs them that the sword was made in
            Gondolin, a city long ago destroyed, where Elrond's father lived as
            a child.
          </p>
          <p>
            After escaping from the Misty Mountains pursued by goblins and
            wargs, the party is carried to safety by the Great Eagles. Gandalf
            then persuades Beorn to house and provision the company for the trip
            through Mirkwood. Gandalf leaves the company before they enter
            Mirkwood, saying that he had pressing business to attend to.
          </p>
          <p>
            He turns up again before the walls of Erebor disguised as an old
            man, revealing himself when it seems the Men of Esgaroth and the
            Mirkwood Elves will fight Thorin and the dwarves over Smaug's
            treasure. The Battle of Five Armies ensues when hosts of goblins and
            wargs attack all three parties. After the battle, Gandalf
            accompanies Bilbo back to the Shire, revealing at Rivendell what his
            pressing business had been: Gandalf had once again urged the council
            to evict Sauron, since quite evidently Sauron did not require the
            One Ring to continue to attract evil to Mirkwood. Then the Council
            "put forth its power" and drives Sauron from Dol Guldur. Sauron had
            anticipated this, and had feigned a withdrawal, only to reappear in
            Mordor.

            <h3>Gandalf the Grey</h3>
            <p>
              Gandalf spent the years between The Hobbit and The Lord of the
              Rings travelling Middle-earth in search of information on Sauron's
              resurgence and Bilbo Baggins's mysterious ring, spurred
              particularly by Bilbo's initial misleading story of how he had
              obtained it as a "present" from Gollum. During this period, he
              befriended Aragorn and became suspicious of Saruman. He spent as
              much time as he could in the Shire, strengthening his friendship
              with Bilbo and Frodo, Bilbo's orphaned cousin and adopted heir.
            </p>
            <p>
              Gandalf returns to the Shire for Bilbo's "eleventy-first" (111th)
              birthday party, bringing many fireworks for the occasion. After
              Bilbo, as a prank on his guests, puts on the ring and disappears,
              Gandalf strongly encourages his old friend to leave the ring to
              Frodo, as they had planned. Bilbo becomes hostile and accuses
              Gandalf of trying to steal the ring. Alarmed, Gandalf impresses on
              Bilbo the foolishness of this accusation. Coming to his senses,
              Bilbo admits that the ring has been troubling him, and leaves it
              behind for Frodo as he departs for Rivendell.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the next 17 years, Gandalf travels extensively, searching for
              answers on the ring. He finds some answers in Isildur's scroll, in
              the archives of Minas Tirith. He also wants to question Gollum,
              who had borne the ring for many years. Gandalf searches long and
              hard for Gollum, often assisted by Aragorn. Aragorn eventually
              succeeds in capturing Gollum. Gandalf questions Gollum,
              threatening him with fire when he proves unwilling to speak.
              Gandalf learns that Sauron has forced Gollum under torture in his
              fortress, Barad-dûr, to tell what he knows of the ring. This
              reinforces Gandalf's growing suspicion that Bilbo's ring is the
              One Ring.
            </p>
            <p>
              Returning to the Shire, Gandalf confirms his suspicion by throwing
              the Ring into Frodo's hearth-fire and reading the writing that
              appears on the Ring's surface. He tells Frodo the history of the
              Ring, and urges him to take it to Rivendell, saying that he would
              be in grave danger if he stayed in the Shire. Gandalf says he will
              attempt to return for Frodo's 50th birthday party, to accompany
              him on the road; and that meanwhile Frodo should arrange to leave
              quietly, as the servants of Sauron will be searching for him.
            </p>
            <p>
              Outside the Shire, Gandalf encounters the wizard Radagast the
              Brown, who brings the news that the Nazgûl have ridden out of
              Mordor—and a request from Saruman that Gandalf come to Isengard.
              Gandalf leaves a letter to Frodo (urging his immediate departure)
              with Barliman Butterbur at the Prancing Pony, and heads towards
              Isengard. There Saruman reveals his true intentions, urging
              Gandalf to help him obtain the Ring for his own use. Gandalf
              refuses, and Saruman imprisons him at the top of his tower.
              Eventually Gandalf is rescued by Gwaihir the Eagle.
            </p>
            <p>
              Gwaihir sets Gandalf down in Rohan, where Gandalf appeals to King
              Théoden for a horse. Théoden, under the evil influence of Gríma
              Wormtongue, Saruman's spy and servant, tells Gandalf to take any
              horse he pleases, but to leave quickly. It is then that Gandalf
              meets the great horse Shadowfax who will be his mount and
              companion. Gandalf rides hard for the Shire, but does not reach it
              until after Frodo has set out. Knowing that Frodo and his
              companions will be heading for Rivendell, Gandalf makes his own
              way there. He learns at Bree that the Hobbits have fallen in with
              Aragorn. He faces the Nazgûl at Weathertop but escapes after an
              all-night battle, drawing four of them northward. Frodo, Aragorn
              and company face the remaining five on Weathertop a few nights
              later. Gandalf reaches Rivendell just before Frodo's arrival.
            </p>
            <p>
              In Rivendell, Gandalf helps Elrond drive off the Nazgûl pursuing
              Frodo, and plays a leading role in the Council of Elrond as the
              only person who knows the full history of the Ring. He reveals
              that Saruman has betrayed them and is in league with Sauron. When
              it is decided that the Ring has to be destroyed, Gandalf
              volunteers to accompany Frodo—now the Ring-bearer—in his quest. He
              persuades Elrond to let Frodo's cousins Merry and Pippin join the
              Fellowship.

              The Balrog reached the bridge. Gandalf stood in the middle of the
              span, leaning on the staff in his left hand, but in his other hand
              Glamdring gleamed, cold and white. His enemy halted again, facing
              him, and the shadow about it reached out like two vast wings. It
              raised the whip, and the thongs whined and cracked. Fire came from
              its nostrils. But Gandalf stood firm. "You cannot pass," he said.
              The orcs stood still, and a dead silence fell. "I am a servant of
              the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. You cannot pass.
              The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn. Go back to the

              Caradhras in winter, they cross under the mountains through the
              Mines of Moria under the Misty Mountains, though only Gimli the
              Dwarf is enthusiastic about that route. In Moria, they discover
              that the dwarf colony established there by Balin has been
              annihilated by orcs. The Fellowship fights with the orcs and
              trolls of Moria and escapes them.

              At the Bridge of Khazad-dûm, they encounter "Durin's Bane", a

              enable the others to escape. After a brief exchange of blows,
              Gandalf breaks the bridge beneath the Balrog with his staff. As
              the Balrog falls, it wraps its whip around Gandalf's legs,
              dragging him over the edge. Gandalf falls into the abyss, crying

              Tolkien's biographer Humphrey Carpenter relates that Tolkien owned
              a postcard entitled Der Berggeist ("the mountain spirit"), which
              he labelled "the origin of Gandalf". It shows a white-bearded man
              in a large hat and cloak seated among boulders in a mountain
              forest. Carpenter said that Tolkien recalled buying the postcard
              during his holiday in Switzerland in 1911. Manfred Zimmerman,
              however, discovered that the painting was by the German artist
              Josef Madlener and dates from the mid-1920s. Carpenter
              acknowledged that Tolkien was probably mistaken about the origin
              of the postcard. An additional influence may have been
              Väinämöinen, an old and wise demigod and the central character in
              Finnish folklore and the national epic Kalevala by Elias Lönnrot.

              Throughout the early drafts, and through to the first edition of
              The Hobbit, Bladorthin/Gandalf is described as being a "little old
              man", distinct from a dwarf, but not of the full human stature
              that would later be described in The Lord of the Rings. Even in
              The Lord of the Rings, Gandalf was not tall; shorter, for example,

              When writing The Hobbit in the early 1930s Tolkien gave the name
              Gandalf to the leader of the Dwarves, the character later called
              Thorin Oakenshield. The name is taken from the same source as all
              the other Dwarf names (save Balin) in The Hobbit: the "Catalogue
              of Dwarves" in the Völuspá. The Old Norse name Gandalfr
              incorporates the words gandr meaning "wand", "staff" or
              (especially in compounds) "magic" and álfr "elf". The name Gandalf
              is found in at least one more place in Norse myth, in the
              semi-historical Heimskringla, which briefly describes Gandalf
              Alfgeirsson, a legendary Norse king from eastern Norway and rival
              of Halfdan the Black. Gandalf is also the name of a Norse sea-king
              in Henrik Ibsen's second play, The Burial Mound. The name
              "Gandolf" occurs as a character in William Morris' 1896 fantasy
              novel The Well at the World's End, along with the horse
              "Silverfax", adapted by Tolkien as Gandalf's horse "Shadowfax".
              Morris' book, inspired by Norse myth, is set in a pseudo-medieval
              landscape; it deeply influenced Tolkien. The wizard that became
              Gandalf was originally named Bladorthin.

              Tolkien came to regret his ad hoc use of Old Norse names,
              referring to a "rabble of eddaic-named dwarves, ... invented in an
              idle hour" in 1937. But the decision to use Old Norse names came
              to have far-reaching consequences in the composition of The Lord
              of the Rings; in 1942, Tolkien decided that the work was to be a
              purported translation from the fictional language of Westron, and
              in the English translation Old Norse names were taken to represent
              names in the language of Dale. Gandalf, in this setting, is thus a
              representation in English (anglicised from Old Norse) of the name
              the Dwarves of Erebor had given to Olórin in the language they
              used "externally" in their daily affairs, while Tharkûn is the
              (untranslated) name, presumably of the same meaning, that the
              Dwarves gave him in their native Khuzdul language.

              Gandalf's role and importance was substantially increased in the
              conception of The Lord of the Rings, and in a letter of 1954,
              Tolkien refers to Gandalf as an "angel incarnate". In the same
              letter Tolkien states he was given the form of an old man in order
              to limit his powers on Earth. Both in 1965 and 1971 Tolkien again
              refers to Gandalf as an angelic being.

              In a 1946 letter, Tolkien stated that he thought of Gandalf as an
              "Odinic wanderer". Other commentators have similarly compared
              Gandalf to the Norse god Odin in his "Wanderer" guise—an old man
              with one eye, a long white beard, a wide brimmed hat, and a staff,
              or likened him to Merlin of Arthurian legend or the Jungian
              archetype of the "wise old man".

              The Tolkien scholar Charles W. Nelson described Gandalf as a
              "guide who .. assists a major character on a journey or quest ..
              to unusual and distant places". He noted that in both The
              Fellowship of the Ring and The Hobbit, Tolkien presents Gandalf in
              these terms. Immediately after the Council of Elrond, Gandalf
              tells the Fellowship:
            </p>
            <p id="box-4">
              <em>
                Someone said that intelligence would be needed in the party. He
                was right. I think I shall come with you.</em
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              Nelson notes the similarity between this and Thorin's statement in
              The Hobbit:
            </p>
            <p id="box-5">
              <em>
                We shall soon .. start on our long journey, a journey from which
                some of us, or perhaps all of us (except our friend and
                counsellor, the ingenious wizard Gandalf) may never return.</em
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              Nelson gives as examples of the guide figure the Cumaean Sibyl who
              assisted Aeneas on his journey through the underworld in Virgil's
              tale The Aeneid, and then Virgil himself in Dante's Inferno,
              directing, encouraging, and physically assisting Dante as he
              travels through hell. In English literature, Nelson notes, Thomas
              Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur has the wizard Merlin teaching and
              directing Arthur to begin his journeys. Given these precedents,
              Nelson remarks, it was unsurprising that Tolkien should make use
              of a guide figure, endowing him, like these predecessors, with
              power, wisdom, experience, and practical knowledge, and "aware of
              own limitations and ranking in the order of the great". Other
              characters who act as wise and good guides include Tom Bombadil,
              Elrond, Aragorn, Galadriel—who he calls perhaps the most powerful
              of the guide figures—and briefly also Faramir.

              Nelson writes that there is equally historical precedent for
              wicked guides, such as Edmund Spenser's "evil palmers" in The
              Faerie Queene, and suggests that Gollum functions as an evil
              guide, contrasted with Gandalf, in Lord of the Rings. He notes,
              too, that both Gollum and Gandalf are servants of The One, Eru
              Ilúvatar, in the struggle against the forces of darkness, and
              "ironically" all of them, good and bad, are necessary to the
              success of the quest.

              The critic Anne C. Petty, writing about "Allegory" in the J.R.R.
              Tolkien Encyclopedia, discusses Gandalf's death and reappearance
              in Christian terms. She cites Michael W. Maher, S.J.: "who could
              not think of Gandalf's descent into the pits of Moria and his
              return clothed in white as a death-resurrection motif?" She at
              once notes, however, that "such a narrow [allegorical]
              interpretation" limits the reader's imagination by demanding a
              single meaning for each character and event. Other scholars and
              theologians have likened Gandalf's return as a "gleaming white"
              figure to the transfiguration of Christ.

              The philosopher Peter Kreeft, like Tolkien a Roman Catholic,
              observes that there is no one complete, concrete, visible Christ
              figure in The Lord of the Rings comparable to Aslan in C. S.
              Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia series. However, Kreeft and Jean
              Chausse have identified reflections of the figure of Jesus Christ
              in three protagonists of The Lord of the Rings: Gandalf, Frodo and
              Aragorn. While Chausse found "facets of the personality of Jesus"
              in them, Kreeft wrote that "they exemplify the Old Testament
              threefold Messianic symbolism of prophet (Gandalf), priest
              (Frodo), and king (Aragorn)."

          <p id="box-6">
            We listened to audio recordings of Tolkien reading excerpts from
            Lord of the Rings. We watched some BBC interviews with him—there's a
            few interviews with Tolkien—and Ian based his performance on an
            impersonation of Tolkien. He's literally basing Gandalf on Tolkien.
            He sounds the same, he uses the speech patterns and his mannerisms
            are born out of the same roughness from the footage of Tolkien. So,
            Tolkien would recognize himself in Ian's performance.
